o Landing Page - Image of people are confused to cross maze and but one person, using stairs, and saw map from top and crosssed the maze quikcly.
o Questions like Word Power Made Easy
    - There is only one way to do calculation in Brain. And we all aware of that. Only smart people adobt the right approach.
	
o Preface: Sometime problems are so obvious and small, but we failes to believe and resolve.
I hopen we all have seen a person who works to break large rock stones. One person can break same rock size stone in just few smashes , but other, with same body-power, spend whole day to break same rock. Where is the difference :
See below GIF:

I hope you undertood, sometime problem is exactly not what we are seeing. Before resolving problem we need realize the actual problem. That makes our efforts precise and efficient. Save energy, save time and save money.

In our case Problem is achieving Fast Brain calculation. When i look inside the problem , i saw that small hidden-problem. I am sure you have also find. 

I would say, we all have same ability of doing Brain Calclation. Challenge is with Memory - this is hidden-problem. 
  
o Questions like Word Power Made Easy
    - There is only one way to do calculation in Brain. And we all aware of that. Only smart people adobt the right approach.
o Problem vs Goal 
	- We all know and agree about Problem identification :  Which is a fundamental step in problem-solving processes.
	- It is important because of Clarity and Understanding , Focused Efforts,Prevention of Symptoms vs. Solving Root Causes,Informed Decision-Making and Risk Management
	- Fast Brain Calculation is not your Problem. This is your goal you want to achieve. 
	- When we gets fever, usually what do we do ? We go to see doctor. Because we problem is not fever , Fever is side effect of that actual problem happened inside our body. 
	- If Fever is the problem, we would have taken some medicine like Paracetamol.We also gets interested to know the root cause of Fevere.
	- Awareness is best: We want to aware ourself and adobt habits in a way that we do get fever again - This is the actual approach.
    - Double Quote: Problem Identification , awareness and acceptance are golden ingrdients to resolve any problem.
    - A Runner, has a goal to win the race. Winning race is not his problem. This is goal to achieve. Then what is his Problem? His problem is not well trained body to win the race. Then again he drill  down his problem, he finds well tarined body is also is goal to achieve his problem is he is not mentally and physical fit to go through tough training. 
	- What do you think, what he should do now? Keep going in training forcefully, because all are going and he don't want to waste time, and problem will be resolved by the time? Sometime answer is    yes. In few case this works but not for all. Do you agree ?
	- Then what he should, stop going in training and do wait get mentally and Physically fit ? Again, Sometime answer is yes. In few case this works but not for all. Do you agree ?
	- Then what he should do ? 1) Awareness and Acceptance: He has to accept and be aware of his actual Problem 2) Then decide how he can quickly resolve that problem 3) Either he choose to go training and or not, he must have to find a way to make him physical and mentally fit for training. 
	- Again writing : Fast Brain Calculation is not your Problem. This is your goal you want to achieve. 
	- So what is your problem then ? I would love to hear your answer:
	- Goal is clear, fast brain Calculation, now Lets take a Doctor's approcah and see how human Mind works to figure out your Problem.
	
o Psychology of Mind
    - (We can change below scenario with Car drivng in Traffic)
	- Lets think in a way, you have just learnt how to drive a car. You have fear of taking it to jam packed lane.
	- If you go there you may meet accident. That's the fear.
	- But how will you do then? 
	- Are you able to figure out your problem now? 1) Car driving skills 2) Pressure Handling 
	- Answer is Pressure handling, because car driving you have already learnt now you have to just remove your fear.  --- Here is the Second Problem.
	- Approch here is quite important and we all are aware of that. 
	- Approach 1- : First we take car in very less crowded road and the gradually increase level as per our confidecne.
	- Approach 2- :Do you agree if someone in same situation, slowly taking car in high Traffic area and meeting accidents but not leaving and going there again and again. and in the last he become good  driver in high   traffic road.
	- Which approach will you take, Definitely Appoach 1. Why ? Because Approach 2 is harmful. We may lose anything.
	- Double Quote: "Do you think same way when attempt mock competition exam paper again and again? No. or we practice speed Calclation test using some tools." 
	- Because here we have nothig lose. Right ? Tell me your answer. 
    - What you don't know that here 1) We are losing our time , energy , confidence and moral  2) What is less pressure handling way to do this practice. 	
    - In most of the case student apply Approach 2, and in the end they most of them get success, but on the cost of Time and money. Sometime it may take them years to pass through.
	- I suggest students should adopt Approach 1. In next topic, we will disucss 	
	
o Human Mind do calculations 
	- Phone memory and CPU example. Two phones are having same processor but different Memory (RAM). Then which one will be faster, phone which is having more RAM though both are having same processor. 
	- Have you ever think, Processor is like human-brain of Mobile, then why mobile having more 8 GB RAM is faster than mobile having 4 GB RAM.
	- Double Quote: RAM stands for Memory and Processor stands for brain. The processor is the brain of the computer. It performs calculations, executes instructions, and manages the overall operation   of the computer
	- Above statement is having answer of your problem. 
	- What do think which is responsible for high speed ? RAM or Processor or Both. Your answer?
	- Double Quote: My thought, In case mathematic Calculations, we all have same kind of Processor. But not RAM.
	- Do you agree Person is having faster brain calculations because of his/her memory or brain do fast calculations ?
	- How do you calculate 5*3 or 10*2 . Definitely you have answer.But how did you do that? Using Brain Calculation ? Select Yes or No to answer.
	- Answer is Memory. Actual calculation of 2*5 = 10 is 2+ 2+ 2+2+2 = 10. But did our mind do that no, we answer stored in our mind and we just fetched that. So we do with 25*2 or 30*2
	- So how our mind works, first it check in the memory, if answer is there then fetch and display. If not then do calculation.
	- Similar when someone ask 78*4 , First your mind will attempt to search the result of this in your mind, which we usually don't have. In second attempt, mind starts of doing Calculation, but fails.  Though we know actual and only way to calculate then Why ?  --- Here is the first Problem.
	- Quote: Usually a Person who is having fast brain calculation do not remembers trick or table more than 20 or 30. Sometime not even remember table till 20. 
	- And do you believe, 95% of them never do practice as wll to do calculations. 
	- Then how is he fast than the one who has answer in memory? 
    - Answer is Memory ? Really !! Do we need to remember trcik and tables then ? No. Not necessary (keep in bold). 
    - Double Quote: : "Keeping in number in mind is actual Problem not brain Calculation. We all know ways and how to do Calculation." 
    - I would love to hear from, if you have figured out which memory i am talking about.
    - How much you are agree with me that memory has major role in brain calculation.

o How smart people do calculations 
    - Recap: 
	- Shoe Lace example here
	- We all have same kind of Brain Calculation ability.
	- Till now we have figured out our two major Problems 1) Memory 2) Pressure Handlings
    - Now in next steps we will discuss nothing new. We all know those steps but only thing smart people do follow
	- Think about a person who is having Fast brain calculation. 
	- Now let me ask you same question: what 3*4, 15*5 then both will you answer 12 and 75.
	- 8+7 or 9+4 both will answer 15 and 13.
	- Now let me ask 68* 9. 
	- How he will he do : 8*9 = 72 then 6*9 = 54. then 54+7 = 61 and write answer 612  ---> You also know he is doing same thing in mind. That's why he is fast.
    - But take closer look again, what is that in this "8*9 = 72 , 6*9 = 54. then 54+7 = 77 and write answer 612" which you can't do in your mind. 
	- If i ask both of you steps individually 8*9,6*9,54+7, you both will tell answers in same time
	- Whatever he is doing you can also do, so brain calculation is not a problem.
	- Most people will think , that smart person can do same process fast because their smart mind. Do you agree?
	- But i challenge, if you both can do these steps separtely "8*9,6*9,54+7" in same time, then you both can tell answer of 68* 9 in same time.
	- Have you figured out the problem ? Is it Pressure handling or Fear ? If yes, your are 50% correct which is our second Problem.
	- Have you figured out our first Problem - Memory ? if you have understood, can you tell how me how memory or visualization is playing role here.
	- RAM vs CPU(Processor) : The differnce in this step "8*9,6*9,54+7" is RAM. Keep in mind here RAM is also same for both you. The only thing he is good to use that.
	
o Problem Solver
   
    - Okay, Good enough that we know our Problem. Let's talk about solution.
    - "Solution is quite obvious :) Solution of Fear is Memory. "
    - Now we have traet only one Problem, Memory: which is RAM of our mind.
    - RAM: 
		-> RAM is a type of computer memory that provides high-speed access to stored data. 
		-> It is used to temporarily store and quickly retrieve data that the processor needs to actively operate on. 
		-> RAM is volatile memory, meaning it loses its contents when the power is turned off.
	
	- First two lines are challenge of your Problem and Third is almost same for all of us.
	- Let me ask you same question again:
	68* 9. 
	- How he will he do : 8*9 = 72 then 6*9 = 54. then 54+7 = 77 --> are you agree that only Three steps are involved?
	- Is there any Fourth step do you know which is missing and that is the actual pain point of your mind?
	- If you figured out, congratulation you have identidied your actual problem and certainly its not Brain calculation. We would love to hear your voice
	- If not, read above three line about RAM.
	- The major Problem is Keeping number in Your Mind and fetching fasly when required to use. Able to connect now?
	- Lets see how:
	68* 9. :-  (60*9 +8*9 = 540 + 72 = 612)  540 + 72 = 
	
	
	1. 60+8
	2. 8*9  --- > 72
	3. 60*9 -----> 540
	4. 540+72  == 612
	
	
	68* 9  -->
	
	Let's see actual steps you followed:
		1) 8*9 = 72
		2) 72 , you stored this in your mind 
		3) 6*9 = 54
		4) 54 , you stored this in your mind 
		5) You went to your mind to retrieve result of step 1
		6) You took 7 from 72
		7) You went to your mind to retrieve result of step 3
		8) You added with 54+7 = 61
		9) went again to your find, to get other number which is 2.
        10) mind write result like 612:- Your answer.

   - Smart people only win race in step number 2, 4, 7 and 9. Which is due RAM of our Mind. 

solution: This time, We need to increase RAM not CPU( Processor).
We all have almost same ability of Brain calculation. Only challenge is keeping number in mind fetching when it required.  

In next chapter, we will start working on Solution. 
	
o Work on Solution:
Our main focus will remain on two Techniques
 - Go Fast slowely : Doing work with patience and calmness brings miraculous result. With regular practice we speed up while keeping mind calm. Patience helps brain to fetch results stored in Memory and doing process. (good for both RAM and CPU of your mind)
 - Rock Breaking technique: Example Rock breaking using Sledgehammer and Tensil stress Technique: We will hit at specific area of the objective. Cracks will help to break rock of our problem.
 
Excerices: Challenge -- while attempting Question, make sure you are keeping calm. You may loose time but patience is important.
                     -- Our motive is to go slow for fast. Feel happy and okay to increase time. We believe what ever you are doing in 5 sec, after 7 days will be able to do in 2 secs.
					 -- First make competition with yourself by going slow and calm 
1) Increasing RAM : 
Exercise Level --> 1) Natural 2) Real Time 3) Exam Test ( give bell icon to press if start loosing patience)
